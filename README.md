# Programing in Lua[^1]

## About the Book

I am following along with [Programming in Lua](https://lua.org/pil) and decided to upload my *work* to GitHub incase someone finds it helpful.  ~~Also to make as a backup copy.~~
If you do find this helpful, I recommond following along with the book yourself.

## Support Lua

If you are interested in Lua, I urge you to donate by buying either the [hardcopy](https://https://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/8590379868/lua-pilindex-20) or the [ebook](https://feistyduck.gumroad.com/l/programming-in-lua-fourth-edition-ebook) of [Programming in Lua (Fourth Edition)](https://https://lua.org/pil/).  If you are not interested in that particual book, you can [buy other books that directly support Lua](https://lua.org/donations.html).  If books don't tikle your fancy, you can buy Lua merch on [Zazzle](https://zazzle.com/store/lua_store)
If you would rather just donate directly, you can do so though PayPal.  If you wish, you can be [publicly acknowledged](https://lua.org/thanks.html); by default you remain anonymous when donating.

If you are not in a position to donate money towards the project, you can donate something arguably more valuable than money, **time**.  You can do this by writing documentation, writing guides, contributing artwork, helping translation, providing support, and even just reporting bugs.

### Supporting FOSS

For more about support [Free Software](https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), I recommend '[HOWTO Pay for Free Software](https://files.puzzling.org/wayback/pay-for-foss/)' by [Mary Gardiner](https://mary.gardiner.id.au/).
